В5. The stage of linking the recognized reference records with metadata of appropriate papers available at ComRIS. The procedure T17 makes this. Its results are visualized at the papers pages (A9). 	

Т17. To create a procedure for linking the recognized records with related papers available at ComRIS. Using the records data the procedure makes a search of appropriate papers at ComRIS. If the search gives a paper, the procedure modifies record data into citation relationships by adding into it the found paper’s ID. Performers: JMB, TK and VL. Duration – 1 m.

В5.1. If the procedure T17 found within ComRIS a paper, which is specified in some reference list record, the linking status is the “success”. The linked reference records are modified by adding into their data the unique ID of the found papers. Since after that it includes ID of both: the citing and the cited papers, we call such objects the “citation relationships”. To provide a public control over processing results at this stage (A9) the procedure T18 visualizes created citation relationships on the both citing and cited papers pages in a form of semantic linkages between them.	

Т18. To create a visualization of the citation relationships on the pages of citing and cited papers. Performers: SP and RP. Duration – 1 m.

В5.2. The unlinked reference records (with the “failure” linking status) by the procedure T19 are also visualized at the papers’ pages. 	

Т19. To create a visualization of the currently unlinked reference records on pages of related papers. Performers: SP and RP. Duration – 1 m.

В5.2.1. Since ComRIS is constantly replenished by new papers, for the currently unlinked reference records the proper papers can be found and these records can change their status on the “linking success”. The procedure T20 makes regular attempts to find at ComRIS the linking papers for all currently unlinked reference records.	

Т20. To create a procedure of regular running of the procedure T17 for currently unlinked reference records. Performer: VL. Duration – 1 m.

В5.2.2. Authors of papers with unlinked reference records by the procedure T21 can enter manually links to the proper papers, if such papers exist at ComRIS, but were not found by the procedures T17 or T20. To provide public control over such actions (A9.1) the citation relationships created manually are specially highlighted at the papers pages. 	

Т21. To create a procedure for authors of papers with unlinked reference records to enter a hyperlink to appropriate paper available at ComRIS. Performers: SP and RP. Duration – 1 m.
