В2. The stage of checking open access to papers full texts for each paper received from the stage B1. The procedure T2 makes this. It uses the RePEc/Socionet full text storage (A3). The procedure also checks if paper’s metadata includes reference list of the paper. Some commercial publishers (e.g. Springer) provide reference lists of papers into its metadata. 	

Т2. To create a procedure of checking for the papers ID received from B1 an open access to the papers’ reference list or its full text. It starts checking in the RePEc/Socionet full text storage (A3). If no needed data at this storage, the procedure check a paper’s metadata for the reference list. If no, it tries a full text hyperlink at paper’s metadata. At the procedure’s output should be status information about checking results (failure, reference list as text, reference list as PDF, full text as text, full text as PDF) and a hyperlink to found reference list of full text. Performer: VL. Duration – 1 m.

В2.1. If T2 gets a positive result of searching, it provides for the next stage one of following: 1) a reference list of the paper as a text; 2) a full text of the paper as a text; 3) reference list or full text as PDF.	

В2.2. If T2 has a negative result for a paper, the procedure T3 visualizes this information for paper’s authors/publisher and for all user at the page of the paper available at ComRIS (A4). 	

Т3. To create a visualization of status information on open access to the papers reference lists or full texts. This information should be displayed at pages of related papers in ComRIS. Other information systems also should be able to get this information by papers ID for using it on their side. Performers: SP and VL. Duration – 1 m.

В2.2.1. Authors or publishers of papers having the status failure (i.e. no access to full text/reference list) can use the procedure T4 to enter links to or to download a full text or a reference list. All entered data by authors/publishers are visualized (A4) by the procedure T5 at pages of related papers at ComRIS. It allows a public control (A4.1) over correctness of the authors/publishers actions. 	

Т4. (a) To integrate into CitEcCyr the CitEc procedure for authors of papers to add the reference list to their papers metadata. Performer: JMB. Duration – 1 m. 
(b) To create a procedure for authors of papers to enter into the system links to their open access full text. This procedure should be active for authors of papers, if the status of working T2 for the papers is “failure”. Performers: RP, TK. Duration – 1 месяц.

Т5. To create a visualization of data entered by authors/publishers with the procedure T4a+b. These data should be displayed on papers pages at ComRIS. By papers ID this information should be available for external information systems.
Performers: SP, RP and VL. Duration – 1 m.
