В4. The stage of the reference lists processing. The procedure T9 makes a reference list selection, if a paper has not it separately as a part of its metadata. The procedure T10 makes parsing of records from the reference list and bibliographic recognition of each record. 	

Т9. To create a procedure of reference list extraction from papers full text. Parscit can do this for the text versions. The procedure should be developed for processing HTML5 versions. Performers: JMB, TK and VL. Duration – 1 m.

Т10. To create a procedure for parsing of single records within reference lists and forming necessary data for the next stage. Parscit can do this for the text versions. The procedure should be developed for processing HTML5 versions. Performers: JMB, TK and VL. Duration – 1 m.

В4.1. Recognized records from reference lists do not need additional processing. They are visualized at papers pages (A7) by the procedure T11 and passing on to the next stage.  	

Т11. To create a visualization of recognized records from reference lists at pages of related papers. By papers ID this information should be available for external information systems. Performers: SP and VL. Duration – 1 m.

В4.2. Unrecognized records from reference lists are also visualized (A7) at paper’s pages by the procedure T12. Authors of papers with unrecognized records can enter by the procedure T13 the correct data to give these records the recognized status. Additionally, by the procedure T14 the unrecognized records become a part of a special collection of the unrecognized cited papers. Authors can find their papers in this collection and claim them as own papers. After that they have rights, the same as authors of citing papers, to enter the correct data for unrecognized records.  	

Т12. To create a visualization of unrecognized data (records) from reference lists at pages of related papers. By papers ID this information should be available for external information systems. Performers: SP and VL. Duration – 1 m.

Т13. To create a procedure for authors of papers with unrecognized records of reference lists to enter correct records data and make these records recognized. Performers: SP and VL. Duration – 1 m.

Т14. To create at ComRIS a special public collection for unrecognized records of reference lists. To create a procedure for adding unrecognized records into this special collection. Performers: SP and VL. Duration – 1 m.

В4.2.1. Authors of unrecognized citing papers by procedure T15 can enter correct data about their papers and change by this their status on the “recognized”. All data entered by this way together with original unrecognized records are visualized by the procedure T16 at the papers’ pages including names, who entered this data. By this there is a public control (A8) over correctness of the authors’ actions. 	

Т15. To create a procedure for authors of papers that presumably mentioned in unrecognized records to enter correct records data and make these records recognized. It should work as follow: Authors can find presumable their paper among unrecognized records (in the special collection made by T14) and claim this data as own paper. It can be done using the RePEc Author Service or similar at Socionet. After that the system allows authors to enter correct data about unrecognized record in the same way as in T13. Performers: RP and SP. Duration – 1 m.

Т16. To create a visualization of the “correct” data entered by T15, including a name who entered this, together with the initial unrecognized data (records) from reference lists. This information should be displayed at pages of related papers. By papers ID this information should be available for external information systems. Performers: SP and VL. Durations – 1 m.
