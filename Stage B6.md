Т22. To create a procedure of finding and collecting mentions of the reference records within the citing papers, and grabbing the context data around such mentions for enriching related citation relationships. The context data should include substrings of specified length (e.g. 100 symbols) at the right and at the left from the location of each mention. The citation context for each mention should be organized as an information object linked with the parent citation relationship. These objects should be used for a visualization of citation relationships within text of papers (e.g. as annotation of PDF, etc.). Performers: JMB, TK and RP. Duration – 1 m.
